🔍 Task Breakdown & Key Results
🔹 Task 1: Basic Network Scanning
Command:

nmap -v 192.168.1.0/24
Results:

192.168.1.10 → Ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP)
192.168.1.15 → Port 21 (FTP)
---
🔹 Task 2: Reconnaissance
2.1 Hidden Port Scan
nmap -v -p- 192.168.1.10
Hidden Ports Found:

8787 (drb), 47436 (mountd), 50918 (java-rmi), 59995 (nlockmgr), 60004 (status)
2.2 Service Version Detection
nmap -v -sV 192.168.1.10
21/tcp → vsftpd 2.3.4
22/tcp → OpenSSH 4.7p1
2.3 OS Detection
nmap -v -O 192.168.1.10
OS: Linux 2.6.9 – 2.6.33
---
🔹 Task 3: Enumeration Summary
Parameter	Value
Target IP	192.168.1.10
MAC Address	00:0C:29:5D:FE:0B
Open Ports	21 (FTP), 22 (SSH)
---
🔹 Task 4: Exploitation
vsftpd 2.3.4 → Exploited using exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
SMB (Samba 3.0.20) → Exploited using usermap_script
R Services → Access via legacy tools (rexec, rlogin, rsh)
---
🔹 Task 5: Privilege Escalation
Command Used:

adduser swapnil
Result
---
🔹 Task 6: Password Hash Cracking
Tool Used: John the Ripper
Command:

john hashes.txt
john hashes.txt --show
✅ Cracked Password: hello
---
🔹 Task 7: Remediation Recommendations
|Vulnerability   |	Recommendation         |
|----------------|-------------------------|
|vsftpd 2.3.4	   |Upgrade to version 3.0.5 |
|OpenSSH 4.7p1	 |Upgrade to OpenSSH 9.6   |
|Java RMI        |	Disable or restrict via firewall |
|R Services      |	Remove or disable deprecated services|
